# Traffic Policy Overview

The ngrok Traffic Policy engine enables you to define how traffic is managed consistently across your endpoints. It allows you to inspect, manipulate, and manage traffic in a structured way.

Traffic Policy is composed of a few key components:

- [**Phases:**](#phases) Defined points in the traffic lifecycle where you can apply logic.
- [**Phase Rules:**](#phase-rules) The set of conditions and actions applied during specific phases to filter, manipulate, or manage traffic.
- [**Expressions:**](#expressions) Conditions used in Phase Rules to determine when an action should be applied.
- [**Actions:**](#actions) Logic that is triggered when a Phase Rule condition is met.
- [**CEL Interpolation:**](#cel-interpolation) A way to dynamically evaluate variables and macros inside configuration values, such as URLs or headers.

By combining these components, Traffic Policy provides a powerful way to control your traffic flow at a fine-grained level.

## Key Concepts

### Phases

Phases are defined points in the lifecycle of a request as it moves through an ngrok endpoint. Each phase represents a specific opportunity to apply traffic management logic.

[Learn more about Phases →](./phases)

### Phase Rules

Phase Rules specify the logic applied during each phase. Rules are made up of expressions (conditions) and actions, which determine how traffic is handled.

### Expressions

Expressions are a powerful way to define conditions under which specific actions in a [Phase Rule](./rules) are triggered.

[Learn more about Expressions →](./expressions)

### Actions

Actions define what happens when a [Phase Rule](./rules) on a [Phase](./phases) conditions are met. Actions allow you to manipulate, route or manage traffic in various ways.

### CEL Interpolation

CEL Interpolation allows you to dynamically evaluate variables and macros inside your configuration values for actions.
